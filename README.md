# EFHimpacts 

Simulate population dynamics for a given species based on generic inputs and analyze effect of juvenile and spawning ground habitat degradation/restoration on population dynamic.
We applied this framework in the Western Baltic Sea to explore population responses of cod, plaice and herring which face hypoxic conditions in their EFH.

Use run_simu.R to perform an analysis
